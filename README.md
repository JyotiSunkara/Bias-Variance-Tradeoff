# Bias-Variance-Tradeoff

 Calculation of the bias and variance after training two models.

 ## Getting Started

 ## Task 0
 
 - 5000 entries
 - 90:10 split of data as training set and testing set done once
 
- [ ] Training set split into 10 sets to create 10 different models for each eqaution
- [ ] Bias-Variance tradeoffs of the models analysed using Bias<sup>2</sup> versus Variance graphs and bulls eye graphs.
